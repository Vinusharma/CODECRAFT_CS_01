it is a simple python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
(internship task/project)
How It Works:
1. Encrypt Mode: Each alphabetic character is shifted forward by the given number (shift)
2. Decrypt Mode: The shift is reversed by negating the shift value.
3. Non-Alphabetic Characters: They are kept unchanged
